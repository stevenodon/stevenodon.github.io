            <p class="justify">I believe that I have the skills that are required for this position. I'm a hard, dedicated worker with a creative mind and drive that will constantly strive to become better and learn more about the relevant skills in the modern world. I'm young with a vast background already behind me and have proven to produce work of high standards beyond what is expected of someone my age. This have been proved by schools that have given me leaving certificate classes to teach; marking leaving certificate scripts straight after graduating to being part of the appeals processing and becoming an advisor for this process to working in a board education range with many demands at Lismore Heritage Centre). I constantly want to better myself and will continue to learn skills that will only aid myself and that company I work for.</p>

            From my experience working for Lismore Heritage Company, I have a vast knowledge of the education system in Ireland at both primary and secondary level. I have been part of a team were developing workshops to be delivered at both levels was priority and working as part of a team was necessary. Because of this and my experience as a teacher, I have a high sense of professionalism and a continued working knowledge of education in Ireland.

            As my time at Lismore Heritage Centre was part spent during the beginning of the pandemic, and being part of the State Examinations with the new system of marking online, I have developed skills that are required to work online remotely while also sticking to a tight timeframe. I have a vast knowledge of communication applications such as Zoom, Teams, Projects, Skype and FaceTime that are currently being used and experience in communication at different levels because of my retail and telecommunications experience.

            I consider my work to be of high standards and consistently professional. I have worked on many professional documents for my pervious employers and have proven to have a high written ability that is suited to purpose of the situation. Beyond my written ability, I consider myself quite tech savvy. In my previous position at Lismore Heritage Company, I created media that was used for promotion of products and delivering historical information. This ranges from posts on Facebook and Instagram to insightful videos on YouTube. For myself, I work on digital pieces using iOS software that go from not just videos, but to digital art pieces and graphics. I use many different editing programs (MS Office, iWork programs, iMovie, SketchBook, Procreate). I'm currently learning HTML and CSS to expand my knowledge and because of it's ties to webpage development and layout. I can safely say that I have a keen interest in this area and will be pursuing further learning in the area of programming and web development.

            Primarily, my degree is in education for second level in which case, I have a vast knowledge of the education system and relevant learning methods.  I am currently expanding my own knowledge by learning more about psychology and educational psychology. My degree considered a lot of modern learning methods with a focus on educators being facilitators to learning. My methods of teaching and learning are based on this as I consider myself an activist professional; the needs of the student come first before one's self. </p>
